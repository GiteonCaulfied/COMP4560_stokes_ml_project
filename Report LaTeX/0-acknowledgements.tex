Also, I wish to acknowledge all the people who have guided and aided me over the past semester.

To Alberto F. Mart\'{\i}n, you have been a remarkable mentor, the best of the best. Thank you for your continuous support and encouragement, as well as the invaluable assistance and prompt feedback you provided throughout this semester. No matter how many stupid questions I asked, you were always willing to help and answer them in much details. I could not have asked for a more dedicated, enthusiastic and invested supervisor with a vast and oceanic soul.

To Rhys P. Hawkins, thank you for supporting me in doing a project highly related to Earth Science, which I have almost zero background before this project apart from what I have learned in high school. Now I am something of a Earth Science researcher myself.

To Siavash Ghelichkhan, thank you for providing the huge amount of data for this project. I appreciate your help.

And finally, I wish to thank my only two friends and my family for being there for me over this busy semester.
