\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

If you wish to do so, you can include some Acknowledgements here. If you don't want to, just comment out the line where this file is included.

There is absolutely no need to write an Acknowledgement section, so only do so when you want to -- i.e., if there's somebody you really want to thank (for example if you received extraordinary supervision). The more important the work, the more likely that an Acknowledgement section doesn't look off. In a 24 pt.\ Honours thesis it would for example look more reasonable than for a 6 pt.\ project report.\\

\textbf{Unrelated to the Acknowledgements, but important:}

\emph{Note that there exist two different title page designs.} You may choose the one that you find more appealing. Just use the configuration file to select this style. There, you also have to put in all the other information about this report like your name, the kind of report (Honours vs non-Honours) and so on.
