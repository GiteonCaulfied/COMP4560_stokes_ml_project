## Instructions for generating LaTeX bib file automatically

* Install Julia REPL on your computer (https://julialang.org/downloads/)
* Run the command 
    ```bash
    julia ./generate_bib_file.jl
    ```
  from the same directory where the `generate_bib_file.jl` script is located.

* See README.md file [here](https://github.com/BadiaLab/BibHandler.jl/blob/master/README.md)
  for additional features of BibHandler.jl, i.e., the Julia package that the 
  `generate_bib_file.jl` script leverages
