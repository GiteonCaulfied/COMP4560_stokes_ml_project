# COMP4560_stokes_ml_project
A repository that we are going to use to keep track of project evolution, notes, ideas, etc.

I am going to use this repository as a sort of research diary with my own notes on the project

## LaTeX project report templates

## Geoid Inversion For Mantle Viscosity With Convolutional Neural Networks

Highly related master thesis from Uni Houston

## Very illustrative/intuitive blog posts on VAEs

## Interesting article on the concept of spherical CNNs 

Not sure if this can be exploited in the geoid problem, though ...
